# RazerBatteryDisplayer

***This is a personal hobby project and was has not been properly tested!***

Small python program to load and display the current battery charge of the Blackshark V2 Pro.
I use the log-file from Razer Synapse to update the charge level, so running Razer Synapse is required.
